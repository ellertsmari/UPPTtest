# Frontend Starter — Usage

This repository contains a minimal HTML/CSS/JS starter structure.

Files created:
- `index.html` — main HTML file (links `css/styles.css` and `js/script.js`).
- `css/styles.css` — basic variables, layout, and responsive rules.
- `js/script.js` — small DOM interactions: theme toggle and form handler.

How to open locally

- Easiest: open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click or `Open File`).

- For a small local server (recommended for modules or fetch requests), run (Python 3):

```bash
# from the repository root
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

Next steps / ideas
- Add a build system (Vite, Parcel) for modern workflows.
- Add unit tests and linting.
- Expand CSS with utility classes or a design system.
